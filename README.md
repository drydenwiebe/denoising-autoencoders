# denoising-autoencoders
Some experimental code for denoising autoencoders. Expirements run in a Google Cloud instance with GPU capabilites. When other repositories are used as a template that is cited in the appropriate file.

variational_denoising_autoencoder.py trains a simple, fully connected variational autoencoder (to de-noise) on the MNIST dataset.

conv_variational_denoising_autoencoder.py trains a more complicated, convolutional variational autoencoder autoencoder (to de-noise) on the MNIST dataset with colours added.

requirements.txt is the requirements for the environment to run this project.
